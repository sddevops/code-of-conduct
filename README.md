# San Diego DevOps Code of Conduct

TL;DR Be kind to everyone. Note that people may operate under different definitions of kind; try to use the superset.

San Diego DevOps is a community intended for learning, networking, and collaboration and has members with different backgrounds and perspectives from all over the greater San Diego area and beyond.

Diversity is one of our strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask everyone, including organizers, to adhere to. Further, organizers have a duty to try and make San Diego DevOps a safe environment for everyone.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by San Diego DevOps. This includes online chat, mailing lists, and in-person events.

* **Be friendly and patient**.
* **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to: members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.
* **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of San Diego DevOps should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside of the San Diego DevOps community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose**. We are a community of members with a wide range of backgrounds and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    * Discriminatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Posting other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    * Unwelcome sexual attention.
    * Advocating for, encouraging, or threatening any of the above behavior.
    * Repeated harassment of others. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and San Diego DevOps is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of San Diego DevOps comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Rather, offer to help resolve issues and help learn from mistakes.

If you experience or witness disregard for this code of conduct please report it to an organizer as soon as possible. Even if you do not want any action taken it is useful for organizers to be informed so they might notice behavioral patterns and take action before a serious problem occurs.
